            "Rahul Sharad Dravid (/ˌrɑːhʊl drəvɪd/&#32;ⓘ; born 11 January 1973) is a former player, ex-captain and ex-coach of the Indian national cricket team.&#91;2&#93; Known for his outstanding batting technique,&#91;3&#93; Dravid scored 24,177 runs in international cricket and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; He is colloquially known as Mr. Dependable and often referred to as The Wall.&#91;7&#93; He won the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy as a member of the Indian team and guided the Indian team to victory in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup as the head coach.\n",
            "Prior to his appointment to the senior men's national team, Dravid was the Head of Cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), and the head coach of the India Under-19 and India A teams. Under his tutelage, the Under-19 team finished as runners-up at the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup and won the 2018 U-19 Cricket World Cup. Under his coaching, Indian cricket team finished as runners-up at the 2023 Cricket World Cup and 2023 ICC World Test Championship final and were semifinalist at the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup .\n",
            "Born in a Marathi family and raised in Bangalore, he started playing cricket at the age of 12 and later represented Karnataka at the under-15, under-17 and under-19 levels. Dravid was named one of the best five cricketers of the year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2000 and received the Player of the Year and the Test Player of the Year awards at the inaugural ICC awards ceremony in 2004.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93; In December 2011, he became the first non-Australian cricketer to deliver the Bradman Oration in Canberra.&#91;10&#93;\n",
            "As of January 2022, Dravid is the fourth-highest run scorer in Test cricket, after Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Jacques Kallis.&#91;11&#93; In 2004, upon scoring a century against Bangladesh in Chittagong, he became the first player to score a century in all the ten Test-playing countries (now 12).&#91;12&#93; As of October 2012, he holds the record for the most catches taken by a player (non-wicket-keeper) in Test cricket, at 210.&#91;13&#93; Dravid holds a unique record of never getting out for a Golden duck in the 286 Test innings that he has played during his career. He has faced 31,258 balls, which is the largest number of balls faced by any player in test cricket. He has also spent 44,152 minutes at the crease, which is the highest time spent on the crease by any player in test cricket.&#91;14&#93; Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar are currently the highest scoring partnership in Test cricket history, having scored 6,920 runs combined while batting together for India.&#91;15&#93;\n",
            "In August 2011, after receiving a surprise recall during the ODI series against England, Dravid declared his retirement from ODIs as well as Twenty20 International (T20I), and in March 2012, he announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket. He appeared at the 2012 Indian Premier League as captain of the Rajasthan Royals.&#91;16&#93;\n",
            "Rahul Dravid, along with Glenn McGrath, were honoured during the seventh annual Bradman Awards function in Sydney on 1 November 2012.&#91;17&#93; Dravid has also been awarded the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan, India's fourth and third highest civilian awards respectively.&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93;\n",
            "In 2014, Rahul Dravid joined the GoSports Foundation as a member of their board of advisors. In collaboration with GoSports Foundation, he is mentoring India's future Olympians and Paralympians as part of the Rahul Dravid Athlete Mentorship Programme.&#91;20&#93; Indian badmintonist Prannoy Kumar, para-swimmer Sharath Gayakwad and golfer S. Chikkarangappa were part of the initial group of athletes that were mentored by Rahul Dravid. In July 2018, Dravid became the fifth Indian cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.&#91;21&#93;\n",

            "Early life and education\n",
            "Dravid was born to a Marathi-Speaking Brahmin family&#91;22&#93; in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.&#91;23&#93; His family later moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, where he was raised.&#91;24&#93; His mother tongue is Marathi.&#91;25&#93; Dravid's father, Sharad Dravid, worked for a company that produces jams and preserves, giving rise to the later nickname Jammy. His mother, Pushpa, was a professor of architecture at the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore.&#91;26&#93; Dravid has a younger brother named Vijay.&#91;27&#93;\n",
            "Rahul Dravid attended St. Joseph's Boys High School and earned a degree in commerce from St Joseph's College of Commerce.&#91;27&#93; He was selected to India's national cricket team while working towards an MBA at the St Joseph's College of Business Administration.&#91;28&#93; He is fluent in Marathi, Kannada, English and Hindi.&#91;22&#93;\n",
            "\n",
            "Formative years and domestic career\n",
            "Dravid started playing cricket at the age of 12 and represented Karnataka at the under-15, the under-17, and the under-19 levels.&#91;29&#93; Former cricketer Keki Tarapore first noticed Dravid's talent while coaching at a summer camp in the Chinnaswamy Stadium.&#91;30&#93; Dravid scored a century for his school team.&#91;citation needed&#93; He also played as wicket-keeper.&#91;27&#93;\n",
            "Dravid made his Ranji Trophy debut in February 1991, while still attending college.&#91;31&#93; Playing alongside future India teammates Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath against Maharashtra in Pune, he scored 82 runs in the match, which ended in a draw.&#91;32&#93; He followed it up with a century against Bengal and three successive centuries after.&#91;33&#93; Dravid's first full season took place in 1991–92, when he scored two centuries and finished up with 380 runs at an average of 63.30,&#91;34&#93; resulting in his selection to the South Zone cricket team in the Duleep Trophy.&#91;35&#93; Dravid caught the national team selectors' attention with his positive performances for India A in the home series against England A in 1994–95.&#91;33&#93;\n",

            "International career\n",
            "Debut\n",
            "Dravid received his first call to the Indian national cricket team in October 1994 for the last two matches of the Wills World Series. However, he could not break into the playing eleven and had to return to the domestic circuit.&#91;36&#93; Despite a stellar show in domestic cricket, Dravid was not selected for the Indian team for the 1996 World Cup, prompting an Indian daily newspaper to run an article with the headline – \"Rahul Dravid gets a raw deal\".&#91;37&#93;\n",
            "He eventually made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup, replacing Vinod Kambli.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; He wasn't particularly successful with the bat, scoring only three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan, but took two catches in the match.&#91;40&#93; He followed it up with another failure in the next game, scoring only four runs before being run out against Pakistan.&#91;40&#93;\n",
            "In contrast to his ODI debut, his Test debut was rather successful. He was selected for the Indian squad touring England on the backdrop of a consistent performance in domestic cricket for five years.&#91;36&#93;&#91;41&#93; Fine performances in the tour games including fifties against Gloucestershire and Leicestershire failed to earn him a place in the team for the First Test.&#91;42&#93; He finally made his Test debut at Lord's on 20 June 1996 against England in the Second Test of the series at the expense of injured senior batsman Sanjay Manjrekar.&#91;38&#93;&#91;43&#93; Manjrekar, who was suffering from an ankle injury, was to undergo a fitness test on the morning of the Second Test. Dravid had already been informed that he would play if Manjrekar failed the test. Manjrekar subsequently failed the test. Ten minutes before the toss, Sandeep Patil, the Indian coach, informed Dravid that he was indeed going to make his debut that day. Patil recalled years later:&#91;43&#93;\n",

            "Coming in to bat at no. 7, he forged important partnerships, first with another debutante Sourav Ganguly and then with Indian lower order, securing a vital first innings lead for his team.&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93; Dravid scored 95 runs missing out on a debut hundred as he walked off after getting caught behind to a Chris Lewis delivery.&#91;46&#93; During this match, he also took his first catch in Test cricket to dismiss Nasser Hussain off the bowling of Srinath.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; In the next tour game against British Universities, Dravid scored a hundred.

            "After his Test debut in England, Dravid played in the one-off Test against Australia in Delhi – his first Test in India. Batting at no. 6, he scored 40 runs in the first innings. Dravid batted at no. 3 position for the first time in the First Test of the three-match home series against South Africa in Ahmedabad in November 1996.&#91;44&#93; He failed to perform well in the series, scoring only 175 runs at an average of 29.16.&#91;49&#93;\n",
            "Two weeks later, India toured South Africa for a three–match Test series. Chasing a target of 395 runs in the First Test, the Indian team got bowled out for 66 runs on the Durban pitch that provided excessive bounce and seam movement.&#91;52&#93; Dravid, batting at no. 6, was the only Indian batsman who reached double figures in the innings, scoring 27 not out.&#91;53&#93; He was promoted to the no. 3 slot again in the second innings of the Second Test. He almost won the Third Test for India with his maiden test hundred in the first innings, scoring 148 runs and another 81 runs in the second innings at Wanderers before the thunderstorms, dim light and Cullinan's hundred helped South Africa draw the match.&#91;44&#93;&#91;54&#93; Dravid's performance in this Test earned him his first Man of the Match award in Test cricket.&#91;55&#93; He top scored for India in the series with 277 runs at an average of 55.40.&#91;56&#93;\n",
            "Dravid continued in the same vein in the West Indies, where he once again top scored for India in the five–match Test series, aggregating 360 runs at an average of 72.00, including four fifties.&#91;57&#93; 92 runs scored in the first innings of the fifth match in Georgetown earned him a joint Man of the Match award along with Shivnarine Chanderpaul.&#91;58&#93; With this series, Dravid concluded the 1996-97 Test season, topping the international runs chart with 852 runs from 12 matches at an average of 50.11, with six fifties and a hundred.&#91;59&#93;\n",
            "Dravid continued his successful run, scoring seven fifties in the next eight Tests that included fifties in six consecutive innings (three each against Sri Lanka and Australia), becoming only the second Indian to do so after Gundappa Vishwanath.&#91;44&#93;&#91;60&#93; By the end of 1997-98 Test season, he had scored 15 fifties in 22 Tests including four scores of nineties but just one hundred.&#91;61&#93;\n",
            "During the 1998-99 Test season, Dravid scored 752 runs in seven Tests at an average of 62.66, that included four hundreds and one fifty.

            "The Zimbabwe tour was followed by a tour to New Zealand. The First Test having been abandoned without a ball being bowled,&#91;64&#93; the series started for Dravid with the first duck of his Test career in the first innings of the Second Test and ended with hundreds in both innings of the Third Test in Hamilton. He scored 190 and 103 not out in the first and the second innings respectively, becoming only the third Indian batsman, after Vijay Hazare and Sunil Gavaskar, to score a century in both innings of a Test match.&#91;40&#93;&#91;65&#93; Dravid topped the runs table for the series with 321 runs at an average of 107.00, although India lost the series 0–1.&#91;64&#93;&#91;66&#93;\n",
            "Later that month, India played a two Test home series against Pakistan. Dravid didn't contribute much with the bat. India lost the First Test but won the Second Test in Delhi with Kumble's historic 10-wicket haul. Dravid played his part in the 10-wicket haul by taking a catch to dismiss Mushtaq Ahmed, who was Kumble's eighth victim in the innings.&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; The India-Pakistan Test series was followed by the 1998–99 Asian Test Championship. India went on to lose the riot-affected First Test of the championship against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens.&#91;40&#93;&#91;69&#93; India went to Sri Lanka to play the Second Test of the championship. Dravid scored his fourth hundred of the season at Colombo in the first innings of the match. He also effected a successful run out of Russel Arnold during Sri Lankan innings fielding at short leg. On the fourth morning, Dravid was injured while fielding at the same position when the ball from Jayawardene's pull shot struck his face through the helmet grill. He didn't come out to bat in the second innings due to the injury.&#91;70&#93; The match ended in a draw as India failed to qualify for the Finals of the championship.&#91;71&#93;\n",
            "In a stark contrast to his Test career, Dravid struggled to make a mark in the ODIs.&#91;51&#93; Between his ODI debut in April 1996 and the end of 1998, Dravid regularly found himself in and out of the ODI team.&#91;72&#93;\n",
            "Dravid's first success in his ODI career took place in the 1996 'Friendship' Cup against Pakistan in the tough conditions of Toronto.&#91;73&#93; He emerged as the highest scorer of the series with 220 runs in five matches at an average of 44.00 and a strike rate of 68.53.&#91;74&#93; He won his first ODI Man of the Match award for the 46 runs scored in the low scoring third game of the series.&#91;55&#93; He top scored for India in the Standard Bank International One-Day Series 1996/97 in South Africa with 280 runs from eight games at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 60.73,&#91;75&#93; the highlight being a Man of the Match award-winning performance (84 runs, one catch) in the Final of the series, although his team lost the match.&#91;76&#93; He was the second highest run scorer for India in the four-match bilateral ODI series in the West Indies in the 1996–97 season with 121 runs at an average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 57.61.&#91;77&#93; Dravid scored his first ODI hundred in the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup against Pakistan in Chennai that came in a losing cause.&#91;78&#93;&#91;79&#93; Dravid top scored for India in the quadrangular event with 189 runs from three games at an average of 94.50 and a strike rate of 75.60. However, India failed to qualify for the Final of the series.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;\n",
            "Dravid's achievements in the ODIs were dwarfed by his failures in the shorter format of the game. 14 runs from two games in the 1996 Pepsi Sharjah Cup; 20 runs from two innings in the Singer World Series; 65 runs from four innings in the 1997 'Friendship' Cup; 88 runs from four games in the 1998 Coca-Cola Triangular Series including a 22-ball five runs and a 21-ball one run innings, both against Bangladesh; 32 runs from four games in the 1998 'Friendship' Cup;&#91;44&#93;&#91;49&#93; a slew of such poor performances often forced him to the sidelines of the India ODI squad.&#91;72&#93; By the end of 1998, Dravid had scored 1,709 runs in 65 ODIs at an average of only 31.64 with a low strike rate of 63.48.&#91;82&#93;\n",
            "By now, Dravid had been branded as a Test specialist. While he continued a successful run in Test cricket, he struggled in the ODIs. He drew criticism for not being able to adjust his style of play to the needs of ODI cricket and his lack of attacking capability. Dravid subsequently increased his range of strokes and adapted his batting style to suit the requirements of ODI cricket. He learned to pace his innings cleverly without going for the slogs.&#91;37&#93;&#91;51&#93;&#91;73&#93;\n",
            "Dravid's ODI success began during the 1998-99 New Zealand tour.&#91;37&#93; He scored a run-a-ball hundred in the first match of the bilateral ODI series that earned him his third Man of the Match award in ODIs.&#91;44&#93;&#91;55&#93; His team lost the match.&#91;40&#93; However, his effort of 51 runs from 71 balls in the Fourth ODI resulted in India's victory and earned him his second Man of the Match award of the series.&#91;44&#93;&#91;55&#93; He became the top scorer of the series with 309 runs from five games at an average of 77.25 and a strike rate of 84.65.&#91;83&#93; Dravid scored a hundred against Sri Lanka in the 1998/99 Pepsi Cup at Nagpur, scoring 116 of 118 deliveries.&#91;84&#93; In the next match against Pakistan, he bowled four overs and took the wicket of Saeed Anwar.&#91;85&#93; This was his first wicket in international cricket.&#91;40&#93;\n",
            "Dravid scored two fifties in the 1998–99 Coca-Cola Cup in Sharjah, one each against England and Pakistan.&#91;44&#93; Standing-in as the substitute wicket-keeper in the third match of the series for Nayan Mongia, who was injured during keeping, Dravid effected two dismissals. He first stumped Graeme Hick off Sunil Joshi's bowling, who became Dravid's first victim as a wicket-keeper, and then caught Neil Fairbrother off Ajay Jadeja's bowling.&#91;47&#93;&#91;86&#93; He top scored for India in the tournament,&#91;87&#93; though his last ODI innings was a golden duck against Pakistan.&#91;44&#93;\n",

He contributed to India's 3–2 series win with 208 runs at an average of 41.60, which included 2 fifties and three wickets at an average of 22.66, topping the bowling average chart for the series.&#91;40&#93;&#91;110&#93; His career best bowling figure of 2/43 from nine overs in the First ODI at Kochi was also the best bowling figure of any bowler in that particular match.&#91;40&#93;&#91;111&#93;\n",

Dravid's 196-ball-long resistance finally ended when he got out bowled to Warne for 39 runs.

Ganguly declared the innings at 657/7, setting Australia a target of 384 runs with 75 overs left in the match.&#91;125&#93;&#91;126&#93; India bowled to dismiss Australia for 212 runs in 68.3 overs.

India emerged as the winner of the series, defeating England in the Final – their first victory after nine consecutive defeats in one-day finals.&#91;148&#93;&#91;149&#93; Dravid played as designated keeper in six out of seven matches, effecting nine dismissals (6 catches, 3 stumpings) – the most by a keeper in the series.&#91;150&#93; He also performed well with the bat, aggregating 245 runs at an average of 49.00, including three fifties.&#91;49&#93; His performance against Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI (64 runs, 1 catch) earned him a man of the match award.&#91;151&#93;\n",

Dravid completed his second hundred of the series in the process.&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93; The Indian team declared the innings on 628/8 and then bowled England out twice to register their first test victory in England since 1986.&#91;152&#93;&#91;154&#93; Despite being outscored by Tendulkar, Dravid was named man of the match for his efforts.&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93; Dravid scored a double hundred in the drawn Fourth Test and earned his second consecutive man of the match award of the series.&#91;155&#93; Christopher Martin-Jenkins noted during the Fourth Test:&#91;152&#93; If a Martian were to land on Earth now and be told that the best batsman in the world was playing in this match, he would think it was Rahul Dravid and not Sachin Tendulkar.

The idea was that making Dravid keep wickets allowed India to accommodate an extra specialist batsman. The strategy worked well for India in the World Cup. India recovered from a less than convincing victory against the Netherlands and a loss to Australia in the league stage, winning eight consecutive matches to qualify for the World Cup Finals for the first time since 1983.&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93; India eventually lost the Final to Australia, finishing as runner-up in the tournament.&#91;164&#93; Dravid contributed to India's campaign with 318 runs at an average of 63.60 and 16 dismissals (15 catches, 1 stumping).&#91;49&#93;&#91;158&#93; Highlights for Dravid in the tournament included a fifty against England, 44 not out against Pakistan in a successful chase, and an undefeated fifty in another successful chase against New Zealand.&#91;40&#93;&#91;164&#93;\n",

            "Dravid captained India in the first two of the ensuing three-match test series in the absence of Ganguly, who was injured, and led India to their first-ever Test victory in Pakistan. In only his second test as the team's captain, Dravid took a controversial decision during the First Test at Multan, declaring Indian innings at the fall of the fifth wicket, with the scoreboard reading 675/5 and Tendulkar unbeaten at 194, just six runs shy of a double hundred. He wanted to play against the exhausted Pakistani batsmen, who had been on the field for 150+ overs, in the final hour of the second day's play. While some praised the \"team-before-personal-milestones\" approach of the Indian captain, others criticized Dravid's timing of declaration as there were no pressing concerns and there was ample time left in the match to try to bowl Pakistan out twice. While Tendulkar was admittedly disappointed, both he and Dravid and the team's management denied any rumours of a rift between them, and claimed that the matter had been discussed and sorted amicably behind closed doors. India eventually went on to win the match by an innings margin. Pakistan leveled the series, defeating India in the Second Test. Dravid scored a double hundred in the Third Test at Rawalpindi – his third double hundred of the season. He scored 270 runs – his career best performance – before playing a reverse sweep, trying to force the pace.&#91;citation needed&#93; India went on to win the match and the series – their first series victory outside India since 1993 and first victory ever in Pakistan.

Sandwiched between the two test series, India played a solitary ODI against Pakistan at home to mark the 75th anniversary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The match turned out to be Dravid's last ODI as the designated wicket keeper.&#91;citation needed&#93; In all, Dravid effected 84 dismissals (71 catches, 13 stumpings) in 73 matches as India's designated keeper, which is the fourth highest score behind Dhoni, Mongia and More.

Dravid scored two hundreds and a fifty in the 3-match Test series as both teams drew the series 1-1. He scored both hundreds during the Second Test (110 in First innings and 135 in Second innings), making him only the second Indian and ninth person to have scored two hundreds in the same test on two or more occasions.

Sent out to open the batting in place of an injured Gautam Gambhir, he scored his second successive hundred. His score of 117 again did not secure the team's victory, as a collapse of 6 wickets for 21 runs in the first innings led to a defeat by 319 runs.&#91;179&#93; Dravid failed in both innings in the third test at Birmingham, as India lost by an innings and 242 runs, one of the heaviest defeats in their history.&#91;180&#93; However, during the fourth and final match at The Oval, he opened the batting in place of Gambhir, and scored an undefeated 146 out of India's total of 300, carrying his bat through the innings.

            "Dravid had always been keen on further honing his batting skills in testing English conditions by playing in county cricket. He had discussed the prospects regarding the same with former New Zealand cricketer and incumbent Kent coach John Wright during India's 1998–99 tour of New Zealand. Wright was particularly impressed with Dravid's performance on that tour, especially with his twin hundreds at Hamilton. The talks finally materialized and Dravid made his county debut for Kent in April 2000. His co-debutante Ganguly made his county debuted in the same match, albeit for the opposite team.&#91;202&#93;\n",
            "Kent's offer had come as a welcome change for Dravid. There was too much negativity surrounding Indian cricket marred by the match fixing controversy. Dravid himself had been struggling to score runs in Tests for a while.&#91;40&#93; The county stint gave him a chance to \"get away to a new environment\" and \"relax\". The wide variety of pitches and weather conditions in England and a full season of intense county cricket against professional cricketers gave him a chance to further his cricketing training.&#91;202&#93;\n",
            "In his 2nd game for Kent, Dravid scored a 182 runs, propelling them to an innings and a 163-runs victory over the touring Zimbabwe team.&#91;203&#93; Out of 7 first class tour games that Zimbabwe played on that tour, Kent was the only team that defeated them. Dravid hit another fifty runs in a draw against Surrey. The newly appointed vice-captain had to leave the county championship temporarily, missing two championship games and two one-day games, to fulfill his national commitment. The Indian team, Dravid included, fared poorly in the Asia Cup and failed to qualify for the Final. Subsequently, Dravid returned to England to resume his county sojourn with Kent.&#91;40&#93;&#91;202&#93;\n",
            "In July 2000, Kent's away match against Hampshire at Portsmouth was billed as a showdown between two great cricketers – Warne and Dravid. Dravid came out on top. On a dustbowl, tailor-made to suit home team spinners, Warne took 4 wickets but could not take Dravid's. Coming in to bat at 15/2, Dravid faced 295 balls, scoring 137 runs – his maiden hundred in county championships. Dravid scored 73 not out in the second innings, leading Kent to a six wicket victory as Warne went wicketless.\n",
            "In their last county game of the season, Kent needed one bonus point to prevent themselves from being relegated to the Second Division. Dravid made sure they stayed put in the First Division by winning the necessary bonus point with an inning of 77 runs.\n",

He shouldered Kent's batting single-handedly as the second best Kent batsman.

However, he later scored improved his ability to score well in ODIs, earning him the ICC Player of the Year award.&#91;211&#93; His nickname of 'The Wall' in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname.&#91;citation needed&#93; Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket, with an average of 52.31; this includes five double centuries. In one-dayers, he averaged 39.16, with a strike rate of 71.23.&#91;212&#93; He is one of the few Indians whose Test average is better while playing away than at home, averaging almost five runs more on foreign pitches.&#91;213&#93; As of 23 September 2010, Dravid's Test average abroad is 55.53, while his Test average at home is 50.76;&#91;213&#93; his ODI average abroad is 37.93&#91;214&#93; and his ODI average at home is 43.11.&#91;215&#93; Dravid averages 66.34 runs in Indian Test victories.&#91;216&#93; and 50.69 runs in ODIs.&#91;217&#93;\n",

            "In January 2004, Dravid was found guilty of ball tampering during an ODI with Zimbabwe. Match referee Clive Lloyd adjudged the application of an energy sweet to the ball as a deliberate offence, although Dravid himself denied this was his intent.&#91;231&#93; Lloyd emphasised that television footage caught Dravid putting a lozenge on the ball during the Zimbabwean innings on Tuesday night at the Gabba.&#91;231&#93; According to the ICC's Code of Conduct, players are not allowed to apply substances to a ball other than sweat and saliva.&#91;231&#93; Dravid was fined half of his match fee.&#91;231&#93;\n",
            "Indian coach John Wright defended Dravid, stating that \"It was an innocent mistake\". Wright argued that Dravid had been trying to apply saliva to the ball when parts of a losenge he had been chewing stuck to the ball; Dravid then tried to wipe it off.&#91;232&#93; ICC regulations prevented Dravid from commenting about the issue, but former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly also stated that Dravid's act was \"just an accident\".&#91;232&#93;\n",

            "Rahul Dravid has had a mixed record when leading India in Tests.\n",
            "One of Dravid's most debated decisions was taken in March 2004, when he was standing in as the captain for injured Sourav Ganguly. India's first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 runs not out with 16 overs remaining on Day 2. In this test match Sehwag scored a triple century for the  first time in his career. He became the first Indian to score a triple century in test cricket with a score of 309.&#91;233&#93;\n",
            "In March 2006, India lost the Mumbai Test, giving England its first Test victory in India since 1985, enabling it to draw the series 1–1. Some argued that the defeat in Mumbai the result of Dravid's decision to bowl first on a flat dry pitch, which later deteriorated and ended with an Indian collapse in the run chase. Coincidentally, it was Dravid's 100th test match in which the Indians were all out for 100 runs in the second innings.\n",
            "After India failed to qualify for the final of the DLF Cup, Dravid, the skipper, was criticised by former all-rounder Ravi Shastri who said that he was not assertive enough and allowed Greg Chappell make too many decisions.&#91;234&#93; When asked for a response, Dravid said that Shastri, while a 'fair critic', was 'not privy' to the internal decision-making process of the team.&#91;235&#93;\n",
            "He was criticised by Vijay Mallya for not correctly balancing his team after his then-IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore finished seventh out of the eight teams that participated in the 2008 season.&#91;236&#93;\n",
